# 🍽️ Recipe Nation 2.0

## 📖 Description

**Recipe Nation 2.0** is a modern, frontend application I built for discovering and exploring new recipes. Using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, I aimed to create a clean, intuitive, and fully responsive user interface. This project serves as the foundation for a full-stack recipe platform I plan to build.

This is the first version of the project. In the future, I plan to focus on adding a backend and expanding the feature set to include:

- 📤 **Recipe Upload & Download**: To enable the community to contribute and share their own recipes.
- 🤖 **AI Chatbot**: An intelligent assistant to help users find recipes based on ingredients or dietary needs.
- 🖼️ **Image-Based Recipe Searching**: To find recipes by uploading a picture of an ingredient or dish.
